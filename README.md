# StudyGroup
Are you struggling with a particular subject? Need some new studying buddies? StudyGroup cames in your help.
It is an Android Studio app design to find the perfect study group and even create your own study session.
We use firebase to stock details about users and the created events.

## Prerequisites

### Install Git
"Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to 
very large projects with speed and efficiency." [Link to install git](https://git-scm.com/download/).
###Android Studio as your main IDE
The recommended IDE for Android development is [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) because it
is developed and constantly updated by Google,has good support for Gradle, contains a range of useful monitoring
and analysis tools and is fully tailored for Android development.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository onto your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/bonearadu/ICHack20
```
2. Open Android Studio
3. Either press "Open an Existing Android Studio Project" or click File > Open...
4. Navigate to StudyGroup. Press Choose, or OK
5. Wait for the Gradle execution to complete. You should see "app" appear as one of the build configurations
6. Run the application (Run > Run 'App'), choose either a connected device or a simulator to run on
7. Application loads


## How it works
### Login Main
We use 4 buttons and 2 plain texts.
If you are an user, you can login to your account, otherwise you vcan make an account. After making your account, 
you will receive a confirmation mail.

### Create New Group 
If none of the actual groups fits you, you can create a new one and schedule an event.
Being an app initially created for Imperial College, you can choose from a series of departments and faculties.
